             <p>Starting in 2018, I was extremely intrested in coding in general. I talked to a few
               people who knew more then I did. In the end I was recomended to learn Python. As a result,
               I watched a 7 hour video that worked on teaching every small aspect of basic Python.
               I finished this class and got nowhere. I had no idea what to do with what I had learned.</p>
             <br>
             <br>
             <p>With only basic background knowledge, I signed up for a online self paced online course over
               the summer. While working through this class I also worked with my neighbor, who is a software
               developer, to start to get ahead. When I realised I don't even have a use for the analytical power
               of Python, I dropped it. </p>
